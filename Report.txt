-----------------------------------------------------
1. Approach — From Data Cleaning to Model Deployment
-----------------------------------------------------
The dataset winequality-white.csv from the UCI repository contained 4898 records and 12 columns representing chemical properties and wine quality scores.
Data Cleaning:
No missing values were found across columns.
937 duplicate rows were detected and removed, resulting in 3961 unique records.
All features were numeric (float64), and quality was an integer, so no type corrections were necessary.
Data Preparation and Encoding:
The quality column (ranging from 3 to 9) was mapped into four categorical classes:
9–8 → Best
7–6 → Good
5 → Average
4–3 → Bad
The dataset was split into features (X) and target (y) and further divided into training and testing sets (80/20 split). All numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize values.
Model Development:
Several models were trained and evaluated — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. Based on the overall performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model.
Optimization & Deployment:
The Gradient Boosting model was fine-tuned using RandomizedSearchCV, which slightly improved performance. The final optimized model and scaler were saved as model.pkl and scaler.pkl using joblib.
A FastAPI application (main.py) was built to serve predictions via two endpoints:
GET / — welcome message
POST /predict — accepts wine features and returns a predicted quality class.

2. Model Performance Metrics and Interpretation
-----------------------------------------------
The final Gradient Boosting model achieved the following approximate metrics on the test set:
Metric	Score
Accuracy	0.87
Precision	0.81
Recall	0.76
F1-Score	0.79
Accuracy (87%) indicates the model correctly classifies most wines.
Precision (81%) shows that when the model predicts a wine as “Good” or “Best,” it is correct 81% of the time — demonstrating reliability in identifying high-quality wines.
Recall (76%) means the model successfully captures about three-quarters of truly good wines, showing a balanced sensitivity.
F1-Score (79%) balances precision and recall, indicating consistent overall performance.
The confusion matrix revealed that the model performs best on Good and Best categories, with a few misclassifications between “Average” and “Good.” This suggests the model is slightly more precise for high-quality wines, which is beneficial for premium wine identification.

3. Key Features Influencing Wine Quality
----------------------------------------
Feature importance from the Gradient Boosting model identified the top contributors to wine quality:
Alcohol — higher alcohol levels correlate with higher quality ratings.
Density — lower density often indicates better fermentation and purity.
Total Sulfur Dioxide — moderate levels improve preservation, but excess reduces sensory quality.
Volatile Acidity — higher values negatively affect quality (vinegar-like aroma).
Sulphates — positively associated with stability and taste enhancement.
These features are consistent with enological knowledge: balanced acidity, proper sulfur control, and fermentation quality are key to premium wines.
4. Business Insights and Impact
The model provides actionable intelligence to help wine producers enhance production quality and profitability:
Improve Production Consistency:
Monitoring and controlling alcohol and density during fermentation ensures more consistent “Good” or “Best” wines, reducing variability between batches.
Optimize Chemical Use:
Insights on sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity allow producers to adjust dosages precisely, preventing spoilage while maintaining flavor quality.
Quality Segmentation and Pricing:
Predictions can be used to segment wines into pricing categories — for example, label “Best” wines as premium products, while “Average” or “Bad” wines can be blended or sold at lower tiers.
Resource Allocation:
Producers can focus testing and quality-control resources on the most influential features, reducing unnecessary lab costs and improving efficiency.
Overall, the model enables data-driven production and marketing decisions, helping wineries maintain brand reputation, minimize waste, and increase profit margins through consistent high-quality output.

5. Conclusion
-------------
This project successfully delivered a complete machine learning pipeline — from data cleaning to deployment. The optimized Gradient Boosting model provides reliable predictions and interpretable insights that align with real-world winemaking principles. By integrating this model into production processes, wine producers can improve product quality, optimize pricing strategies, and achieve sustainable business growth.
